3D Scene Navigator/Editor for Computational Gemoetry

This a 3D application is written in Processing 2 with the intention of being able to
run the code in Processing.js from a web page. The goal od the application is to
be able to: 

navigate in a 3D space, 
create points in the 3D space,
edit points in the 3D space,
apply geometric relationships to collections of points in the 3D space,
possibly apply constraints to the relationships of the points in 3D space.
