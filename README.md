3D Scene Navigator/Editor for Computational Gemoetry

This a 3D application is written in Processing 2 with the intention of being able to
run the code in Processing.js from a web page. The goal of the application is to
be able to: 

<ul>
<li>navigate in a 3D space, </li>
<li>create points in the 3D space,</li>
<li>edit points in the 3D space,</li>
<li>apply geometric relationships to collections of points in the 3D space,</li>
<li>possibly apply constraints to the relationships of the points in 3D space.</li>
</ul>
